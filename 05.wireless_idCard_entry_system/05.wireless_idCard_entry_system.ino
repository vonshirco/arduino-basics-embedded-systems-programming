/*
The sketch begins by calling on the SPI, RFID, Servo, Pitches, 
and Wire libraries to control communication between the Arduino, 
RFID module, and servo. Two melodies are defined, one for a positive 
reading on your card and the other for a negative reading. The green 
LED is set to Arduino pin 2, the red LED to pin 3, the piezo buzzer 
to pin 8, and the servo to pin 9.
The following line is where you add your cardâ€™s hex value:
----------------------------------------------------------
byte card[5] = {0x4D,0x55,0xAD,0xD3,0x66};
----------------------------------------------------------
Pass your card in front of the reader. If the hex code on the card 
matches that in your sketch, the green LED lights up, a tune plays, 
and the servo moves. The reader rejects all other cards unless you 
add their number to the code at 1. If a card is rejected, the red LED 
lights up and a different tune plays, but the servo does not move.
