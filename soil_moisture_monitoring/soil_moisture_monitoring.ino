/*
The sketch first defines Arduino pin A0 so that it reads the moisture sensor value. 
It then defines Arduino pin 11 as output for the buzzer, and pin 13 as output for the LED. 
Use the Serial.Println() function to send the reading from the sensor to the IDE, in order 
to see the value on the screen.

Change the value in the line

if(analogRead(0) > 900){

depending on the reading from the sensor when it is dry (here itâ€™s 900). When the soil is 
moist, this value will be below 900, so the LED and buzzer will remain off. When the value 
rises above 900, it means the soil is drying out, and the buzzer and LED will alert you to 
water your plant.
