/*
The sketch first sets Arduino pin 11 as an OUTPUT for the piezo buzzer and 
pin 13 as an OUTPUT for the LED. The photoresistor is connected to Arduino pinA0.
If the analog reading from A0 is more than 850 (meaning that there is less light 
and the laser beam has been broken), the buzzer will be set to HIGH and turn on 
and the LED will turn off. Remember to change the resistance value depending on 
your calibration on this line:
------------------------------
if (analogRead(0) > 850) {
------------------------------
As noted earlier, when the laser is shining on the resistor it reads about 620, 
so in the sketch Iâ€™ve set the buzzer to sound only if the value is more than 850.
This value is between our laser value and our nonlaser value, so we know the laser
beam to the resistor has been broken if the value reaches 850.
